# Sex Chromosome Determination of Cancer Cells Using CCLE Expression Counts

Genomic instability is an established hallmark of cancer, however, aberrant sex chromosome complements observed in cancer cells and their subsequent effects are largely under-researched.  X inactivation escape and loss of Y mutations seen in cancer cells have been observed to alter the prognosis of patient outcomes, yet sex as a biological factor continues to be overlooked.  Expression counts for eight sex linked genes: XIST, DDX3Y, EIF1AY, KDM5D, ZFY, RPS4Y1, USP9Y, and UTY will be isolated in order to determine the sex chromosome complements present in 1,019 cell lines obtained from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE).
